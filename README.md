Pinus cembra forests and their microbiology depending on snow-cover

This project contains the analytical scripts and data of the above mentioned manuscript, published in XXX. This github repository contains scripts and data only. Please refer to the manuscript and its supplement for further information. Please feel free to contact us if there are any queries. In total, there are two scripts here that (i) analyse microbiomes, and (ii) infer and analyse association networks. As the network inference took a long time, the network objects are provided. The nets can be found together with the other input data in the data folder. The graph objects are too large to be uploaded here. They can be downloaded via: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qraisjir69gzfbk/nets.zip?dl=0
